            Life isnâ€™t measured only in years, 
            but in moments-sunsets watched, laughter shared, lessons learned. 
            Some live a century without truly living; others, just decades but deeply. 
            Time is fleeting, but meaning stretches moments into lifetimes. 
            We chase longevity, yet what we seek is presence. 
            Life is as long as the love we give, the impact we make, the memories we leave behind. 
            So, how long is life? 
            Long enough to matter-if we choose to make it so.
